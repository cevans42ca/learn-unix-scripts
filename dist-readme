This project contains a suite of scripts to teach various aspects of
Unix.  Although the scripts are written in bash, I intend the exercises
to be broad enough to work on FreeBSD, Macs, Linux, and any system that
has bash installed or could have bash installed.

This project is in alpha status.  Please check back for updates.

Although there's a roadmap for exercises from white belt to black belt,
only the white belt exercises are done.

To run these scripts, put them somewhere in your $PATH.  I suggest
/home/yourUserId/bin or /usr/local/bin.  Start by executing the
"learn" script.
