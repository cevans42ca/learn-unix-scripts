This project runs on a variety of operating systems and configurations.

The scripts can also handle small terminal sizes (smaller than 80 columns).  The very first screen the student is presented with tries to cover all the bases.  The first screenshot is from Cygwin running on Windows 10.

The second screenshot is what the user sees after pressing "q".  It's from Terminus on an iPhone (with the Pro theme) connected to an Ubuntu server running in AWS.
