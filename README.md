# learn-unix-scripts
A set of bash scripts for teaching Unix in general in an interactive way

This project is in alpha status.  I am requesting comments to help shape it into something useful to many people.

I have broken down a series of critical Unix skills into belts that match my taekwondo school's progression.  I have a roadmap set down from white belt to black belt, but only the white belt exercises are ready.

Please see the "readme" file in the distribution for a few options on how to best prepare or install the scripts for your site or workstation.
