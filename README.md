# learn-unix-scripts
A set of bash scripts for teaching Unix in general in an interactive way

This project is in alpha status.  I am requesting comments to help shape it into something useful to many people.

I have broken down a series of critical Unix skills into belts that match my taekwondo school's progression.  I have a roadmap set down from white belt to black belt, but only the white belt exercises are complete.

I will use the term "student" loosely to refer to someone who wants to use these scripts to learn Unix concepts and programs.

There is nothing hidden or encrypted in this project.  The project only contains bash scripts and documentation.  The included scripts are more suited to a corporate environment where a measure of trust on behalf of students is implied or expected, and/or where an audit of the scripts is required or desired.  Students adept at Unix have many possible ways to give themselves a belt they didn't earn.  Indeed, finding possible ways to do so also represents understanding of Unix and should be encouraged, as long as students don't misrepresent their knowledge or completion of the exercises.

If you plan on using these exercises in a classroom setting, you will need to include traditional testing in order to confirm understanding, or you might consider a project with different goals, such as GameShell.  (Disclaimer:  I have no experience with GameShell and don't have a personal or professional relationship with any of the team members.)

Please see the "readme" file in the distribution for a few options on how to best prepare or install the scripts for your site or workstation.
